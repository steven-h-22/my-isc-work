Eastern Atlantic Experiment 97
==============================

The Eastern Atlantic Experiment 97 (EAE-97) produced data from Mace Head, 
Challenger and the Jetstream. The EAE-97 campaign was coincident with EASE-97,
which required Mace Head data. Therefore the data files for Mace Head are 
common to both campaigns. As a result, the macehead subdirectory here is 
a symbolic link to the ease-97/macehead subdirectory.

The symbolic link doesn't function exactly like the original directory, but it
will deal with the addition of new files. The link behaviour is slightly odd:
ls macehead won't list the directory contents, just info about the macehead
link. However ls macehead/* will produce a listing of the files.

Subdirectories:
--------------

* challenger
* jetstream
* macehead (symbolic link to /ease-97/macehead/)

P.S. When visualizing the contents of subdirectory /macehead/ on the Web,
     please allow some time for the files list to appear, are this one is
     rather long.
