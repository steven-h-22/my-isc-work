Dear All,

Some of you may now be aware that there are some corrections available for
the PSAP (sooty) data. However, I do not intend to go back over the existing
data mainly because nephelometer data were not collected for these
campaigns. If you wish to publish work using the existing psap data then
please contact me and I can explain where the errors lie (mostly in
scattering from the sample, which has wrongly been interpreted as
absorption). If you are just using the data as a tracer of tropospheric
pollution, then I see no reason why you shouldn't continue to do so. 

If you notice that I've missed anybody off the mailing list then please
forward this message. 


Best wishes, Hannah
