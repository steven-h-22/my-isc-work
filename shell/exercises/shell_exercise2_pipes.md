# Exercise 2: Pipes and filters

## Aim
Construct a command using pipes and filters to print just the name of the longest file.

## Issues Covered
Commands: `cat`, `wc`, `head`, `tail`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `|`, `*`, `?`
Using shell command completion and history.

## Instructions

Note: use `cd` to change to `ncas-isc/shell/` before starting this exercise.

1. In the directory `acsoe/eae-97/macehead` construct a pipe and filter command to print the file with the most lines. (Hint: use `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `sort` and `cut`)
2. Use the up arrow to edit the last command. Change the command to look for the longest file in characters.  
3. Use `*` to look for the longest file in all the subdirectories of `acsoe/eae-97`.
4. Have a play with the arrow keys and the tab key - what do they do? Try the `history` command.
