## Aim
Try to remember What we did yesterday.

## Issues covered 
Stuff from yesterday.

## Instructions
1. Find the number of Macehead Ozone files in the `acsoe` directory. These files have a `.o31` extension.
2. Find the number of these files that have an `E-MAIL-CONTACT` line set. 
    > (Hint use `cat $(...your find command from 1...)` to start your pipe then use a `grep` filter.)
3. See how many different email contacts there are for these files by sorting your output.  
4. How many different email contacts in all the files under the `acsoe` directory. 
5. Are they really different?
